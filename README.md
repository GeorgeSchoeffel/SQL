# SQL
A repository that contains SQL sample scripts.

Currently there are two sample scripts. The first script contains real data from the Bureau of Transpotation Statistics regarding On-Time and Delay statistics. The scripts are designed to find various statistics, such as: which airports experiences the highest average of delays? How long was the longest delayed flight for each airline? The second script uses data from the university schema, a synthetic dataset designed for SQL queries.
